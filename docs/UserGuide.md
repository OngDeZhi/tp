## 1. Introduction

**Welcome to AniChan!**

AniChan is a free desktop command-line application aimed to improve the efficiency of anime translators. With AniChan, translators could manage their time more effectively by identifying the time needed to translate a script. Moreover, AniChan comes with management features such as workspace, watchlist and bookmark that can help them stay organized and focused on their work.

<br/>

AniChan can also be used on all major operating systems such as Windows and Linux. You can refer to the [Quick Start](#2-quick-start) guide located below for more information on getting your journey started with AniChan!

<br/>

### 1.1 Purpose

This guide provides you with in-depth information on setting up AniChan and how to use the various features offered. 

<br/>

## 2. Quick Start

1.  Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2.  Download the latest version of **AniChan** from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-F12-2/tp/releases/tag/V1.0).
3.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for **AniChan**.
4.  Open **Command Prompt** and change directory into the folder. Run `java -jar anichan.jar`. 
5.  Type a command into the command prompt and press `Enter` to execute it. For example, typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will display the help message.

<br/>

## 3. Features 
**Some useful notes on the Command Format**

*   Commands are case-sensitive.
E.g. Only `help` will work, and so `HELP`, `hElp`, and its other variant will not work.

*   In this guide words in UPPERCASE are values that can be supplied to the command.
E.g. in `browse -s SORT_CATEGORY -p PAGE_NO.` where SORT_CATEGORY and PAGE_NO. are parameters that can be used with `browse -s name -o asc`.

*   Square brackets indicate optional parameters.
E.g. `browse [-s SORT_CATEGORY]` can be used simply as `browse` or `browse -s name`.
  
*   The order of parameters are not important.
E.g. Both `browse -s name -p 2` and `browse -p 2 -s name` are both acceptable and will give you the same result.

> :bulb: Notice that you have an input prompt, this is what it means: WORKSPACE-NAME (WATCHLIST-NAME) #>

<br/>

### 3.1 View the help
This command will provide the details of all available commands and their usage. 
This is done by displaying the ‘Command Summary’ as listed below to the user. 

Format: `help`

<br/>

### 3.2 Estimate time needed to translate the script

This command allows you to figure out the amount of time needed to finish translating a script. It allows you to estimate based on the amount of words you can translate in an hour, or by using the average translators’ speed of 400, 500, and 600 words per hour. Hence, this would help you to better manage your time and also to not promise your clients with inaccurate timings.

<br/>

Format: `estimate <SCRIPT_FILE_NAME> [-wph WORDS_PER_HOUR]`
*   If the option `-wph` is not specified, the average translator's translation speed will be used to produce three estimation timings for you to consider.

<br/>

> :bulb: You have to specify the file extension too! E.g. `script.txt`.

<br/>

Example of usage: `estimate script.txt`

The expected outcome: 
```
Average translator (400 words per hour) takes: 5 hour(s) 47 minute(s).
Average translator (500 words per hour) takes: 4 hour(s) 38 minute(s).
Average translator (600 words per hour) takes: 3 hour(s) 51 minute(s).
```

<br/>

Example of usage: `estimate script.txt -wph 777`

The expected outcome:
```
You would need 2 hour(s) 58 minute(s).
```

<br/>

### 3.3 Browse through anime

This command will provide a realistic **browsing** experience as you are able to ‘flip’ through pages of different anime series. This is a useful way to get a quick overview of all available anime series.

`browse` will also has various options to customise each browsing session by being able to sort the anime list. This can be done through the use of its optional parameters.

<br/>

Format: `browse [-s SORT_CATEGORY] [-o DISPLAY_ORDER] [-p PAGE_NUMBER`]
*   `-s` will indicate how the list is sorted and will accept the values `name` or `rating` 
*   `-o` will arrange the list in descending or ascending order by using the values `asc` or `dsc`
*   The order of the parameter does not matter
*   If no parameters or only `-o` is specified then it will display anime in no particular order.

Here are some commonly used `browse` commands to get you started. Feel free to experiment with different combinations!

*   `browse -s name -o dsc`: browse alphabetically from A - Z
*   `browse -s rating -o dsc`: browse starting from the most highly rated anime

<br/>

Example of usage: `browse -s name -o dsc`

The expected outcome:
```

### 3.10 Saving and loading data

User, workspace(s), watchlist(s), and bookmark(s) data will be **saved automatically** when they are created or modified, and will be **loaded automatically** when **AniChan** is launched. 

In the folder where **AniChan** is launched, there will be a `data` folder which would contain these data:
* User data will be stored in `data/user.txt`.
* Watchlist(s) data will be stored in `data/<WORKSPACE-NAME>/watchlist.txt`, e.g. if "AniTranslator" is the name of your workspace, then the watchlist data can be found in `data/AniTranslator/watchlist.txt`.
* Bookmark(s) data will also be stored in the same location as watchlist data, `data/WORKSPACE-NAME/bookmark.txt`.

<br/>

## 4. FAQ

**Q:** What is a workspace?
<br/>
**A:** Workspace is a functionality in **AniChan** which provides users the flexibility to organise information. 
As application data like watchlist and bookmarks are linked to workspace, switching workspace would provide a 
clean slate environment to work in.

<br/>

**Q:** How can I save my data?
<br/>
**A:** **AniChan** automatically saves your data on every action you take. You can find them in `/data` folder in the same
directory you run **AniChan** in.

<br/>

**Q:** Can I edit the information in `data` directory?
<br/>
**A:** Yes! As **AniChan** saves and loads your information from the data directory, editing the files in `data` folder
works. However, we would strongly recommend you not to as you may cause data corruption. Use **AniChan** instead if you wish to edit your information!
